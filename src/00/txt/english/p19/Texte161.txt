CNAF ?The Caisse Nationale d’Allocations Familiales (CNAF) is the family branch of the French social security system, paying financial aid to families and providing further local, collective social action primarily through technical assistance and grants to local social life (town halls, nurseries, etc.). Every year, the CNAF provides some €69 billion of benefits to 11 million claimants and overall 30 million persons concerned. Its information systems hold highly sensitive data, such as the French government’s minimum income guarantee for low-income households.
