What is NoSQL ?NoSQL is an umbrella term for a loosely defined class of non-relational data stores that break with a long history of relational databases and ACID guarantees. Data stores that fall under this term may not require fixed table schemas, and usually avoid join operations. The term was first popularised in early 2009.NoSQL databases are intended to perform at internet scale and reject the relational model in favor of other (key-value, document, graph) models. They often achieve performance by having far fewer features than SQL databases. Rather than being a "jack of all trades, master of none", NoSQL databases tend to focus on a subset of use cases.
