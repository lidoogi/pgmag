Helping out Japan and JPUGPostgreSQL Users,Our project has a special relationship with Japan, and right now the whole country is hurting. Japan PostgreSQL User Group (JPUG) represents the largest national group of PostgreSQL users in the world, possibly up to 20% of our users worldwide.  Around 1/4 of the code contributors to PostgreSQL come from Japan as well, including both major and minor contributors, several of whom we have still not heard from.As such, we are urging more fortunate supporters of the PostgreSQL project to support Japan in this disaster.  The more aid Japan gets right now, the faster they will be able to recover from the current catastrophe.   The Japanese on the coast need food, medical care, housing and rebuilding in excess of what the Japanese government can quickly supply.We recommend the following organizations for donations to Japan relief:International Federation of The Red Cross/Crescent:http://pgmag.org/0007aDoctors Without Borders:http://pgmag.org/0007bJosh BerkusPostgreSQL Core Team
