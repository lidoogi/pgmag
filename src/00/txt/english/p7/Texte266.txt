PostgreSQL Query Cache releasedIn March, Satoshi NAGAYASU released a software  package that improves query performance (10x-100x) by caching query results in front of backends. The PostgreSQL Query Cache waits for connections from clients on a different port, delegates the  queries to a backend (like a proxy) and caches  SELECT query results. It also manages the lifecycle of the query cache.http://code.google.com/p/pqc/
