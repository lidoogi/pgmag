''TITLE'' : PGXN

''HEADER'':

The PostgreSQL Extension Network (PGXN) is a central distribution system for open-source PostgreSQL extension libraries. It is inspired by the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (CPAN).

''TEXT'':

We've seen that PostgreSQL 9.1 allows developers to create extensions. With PGXN, extensions authors can submit their work together with metadata describing them: the packages and their documentation are indexed and distributed across several servers. The system can be accessed through a web interface or command line clients thanks to a simple API.

A comprehensive PGXN client is being developed. It can be installed with:
  
  $ easy_install pgxnclient
  Searching for pgxnclient
  ...
  Best match: pgxnclient 0.2.1
  Processing pgxnclient-0.2.1-py2.6.egg
  ...
  Installed pgxnclient-0.2.1-py2.6.egg

Among other commands, it allows to search for extensions on the website:

  $ pgxn search pair
  pair 0.1.3
    ... Usage There are two ways to construct key/value *pairs*: Via the
    *pair*() function: % SELECT *pair*('foo', 'bar'); *pair* ------------
    (foo,bar) Or by using the ~> operator: % SELECT 'foo' ~> 'bar';
    *pair*...
  
  semver 0.2.2
      *pair* │ 0.1.0 │ Key/value *pair* data type Note that "0.35.0b1" is less
      than "0.35.0", as required by the specification. Use ORDER BY to get
      more of a feel for semantic version ordering rules: SELECT...

''SUBHEADER'': The new site PGXN.org offers a repository for contributing and downloading extensions.

To build and install them on the system:
  
  $ pgxn install pair
  INFO: best version: pair 0.1.3
  INFO: saving /tmp/tmpezwyEO/pair-0.1.3.zip
  INFO: unpacking: /tmp/tmpezwyEO/pair-0.1.3.zip
  INFO: building extension
  ...
  INFO: installing extension
  [sudo] password for piro: 
  /bin/mkdir -p '/usr/local/pg91b1/share/postgresql/extension'
  ...

And to load them as database extensions:

  $ pgxn load -d mydb pair
  INFO: best version: pair 0.1.3
  CREATE EXTENSION

What can be easier than this ?
