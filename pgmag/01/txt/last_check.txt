===== page 1 =====
we'll ask a bunch of questions of Stephan -> to Stephan
[Actually, "of" is correct here; "to" is wrong. Maybe just say "...we'll ask Stephan a bunch of questions..." :-) - Ray O'D.]

the source files are store -> storeD

In the red box on the left: "Layout Editor : Cédric..." -> "Layout Editor: Cédric..." (i.e. lose the space before the colon).
===== page 2 =====

Reviewers :  Add the following names:  Evan Bennett, Michael Brewer, Gregory Youngblood, Magnus Hagander

"Many thanks to every one that send us
feedback." should read:

"Many thanks to every one that **sent** us
feedback." 

"If you want to join us, just
check out page 34 to see how you can help." should read:

"If you want to join us, just
check out page **35** to see how you can help."

"and we'll try provide you with hard copies" should read:

"and we'll try **to** provide you with hard copies" (this could also be **and**)
===== page 3 =====
It's "Table of Content**s**", not "Table of Content".

===== page 4 =====

PgNext 2012 in Denver is now canceled; we probably shouldn't include it on this page.

There is a white line between the photo and the right edge of the page. (Maybe this is a style choice?)

For consistency:
"http://www.pgday.fr" should end with a '/'
"http://postgresopen.org" should end with a '/'

The three URLs in the right column of boxes do not allow me to click them in Adobe Reader 10.1.3, but work when the document is viewed i Nitro PDF Reader 2.2.1.16 and directly in Google Chrome 18.0.1025.162 m.

In Adobe Reader 10.1.3, the URLs select and copy with a space between the colon and double forward slashes: "%%http: //www.pgday. fr%%", also this one does not work as it tries to load "www.pgday." because of the space before "fr"

----

Also on the upcoming events, page 4 I think, at the bottom I think it's supposed to say:
For more information on local and international PostgreSQL user conferences, check out the wiki !

Instead it starts with "or".

----
===== page 5 =====

"All there questions are
currently being discussed." should read:

"All **these** questions are
currently being discussed."

"Send your opinion about what your read in
PostgreSQL Magazine" should read:

"Send your opinion about what **you** read in
PostgreSQL Magazine"

===== page 7 =====

"PostgreSQL is available as
module inside the Heroku Platform" should read:

"PostgreSQL is available as **a** 
module inside the Heroku Platform"

"http://scalr.net/features/databases/postgresl" should be "http://scalr.net/features/databases/postgres" (remove the 'l')

The link "https://postgres.heroku.com/" cannot be clicked

In Adobe Reader 10.1.3, the link "%%http: //www.npgsql .org%%" does not work because of the space before ".org"

The image from page 6 is slightly overlapping on to the top left edge of this page. (No one will probably notice.)
===== page 9 =====
"The “core infrastructure team” — rather loosely
defined here as the people with root on all
VMs and the VM-Hosts and actively working on
them consists of four people" should be:

"The “core infrastructure team” — rather loosely
defined here as the people with root on all
VMs and the VM-Hosts and actively working on
them **—** consists of four people"



It depends how -> It depends on how

publically -> publicly
===== page 10 =====
"That was a huge thing, the existing website
framework" should be:

"That was a huge thing**;** the existing website
framework"

"We also completely revamped our download
system in the process, this now means that we are
hosting all downloads" should be:

"We also completely revamped our download
system in the process**;** this now means that we are
hosting all downloads"

"The old and often hated page,
with the enourmous amount of flags for the many
countries which we previously used mirrors" should probably be:

"The old and often hated page,
with the **enormous** amount of flags for many
countries which previously used mirrors" (note also removal of words for clarity)
===== page 11 =====
"pgFoundry was a very important
part of the infrastructure in the past to help evolving
and growing the community" should either be:

"pgFoundry was a very important
part of the infrastructure in the past **in** evolving
and growing the community" //OR//:

"pgFoundry was a very important
part of the infrastructure in the past to help **evolve**
and **grow** the community"

----

"we have now evolved to point" should be:
"we have now evolved to **a** point"


----
"There are three large features actually": The first two sections (scalability and better partitions) should use the same emdash that follows "parallel query" for consistency.

----

"PGM: One word about pgFoundry, the PostgreSQL software forge.... There's been some complaints about it. We see lots of projets mo- ving to other 2code sharing plat- forms (such as github) and some community members even think pgFoundry should be closed. What's your opinion?"

\\-> There's been some complaints - plural "some complaints" means it should be "there have been"
\\-> "projets" instead of "projects"
\\-> what's the 2?
===== page 12 =====


that has is overlooked all the time. -> that is overlooked all the time ?

to see table output -> to see a table output

The bottom right paragraph is hard to read (no line feed)

----
Might be too late to ask this question, but do we really need this cartoon here [and on page 3]? Could another one be used that might be funnier and have a little less nudity? (Not used to nipples on my tables of contents.)

=> REPLACE Cartoon with : http://www.flickr.com/photos/12820606@N04/3585943121/
===== page 13 =====
"Yes querying the entire database and pulling out
complete data (That you won't probably do" should be:

"Yes querying the entire database and pulling out
complete data (that you won't probably do" [i.e., no initcap of "that"]


----

"use a different operator for same stuff" should be: "use a different operator for **the** same stuff"

----


"if you have been
moving to some document stores just because the
reason that RDBMS don't provide them" should be EITHER:

"if you have been
moving to some document stores just because the RDBMS doesn't provide them"
OR
"if you have been
moving to some document stores just for the
reason that the RDBMS dosn't provide them"
===== page 15 =====
As an aside: The overall lack of Oxford/serial commas in the magazine really hurts on this page, in which features (especially new ones) are listed, and it's difficult to determine where the split is in the final two entries (i.e., "These include Synchronous Replication, Per-Column Collations**,** and Unlogged Tables" is //much// clearer to read).


----


"participating to the PG Day France" should be: "participating **in** the PG Day France"

----

top pf page, not an error, but perhaps for better flow:

We really struggled to choose the ten most disruptive features to showcase with step-by-step examples.

"is gonna change" - technically valid word use (gonna is in the dictionary), but doesn't seem professional, suggest "is going to change" 

Under "Responding to Users"

I'm torn whether "several features which users have been requesting" is correct, or if it would be better written as "several features that users have been been requesting." I'm leaning towards "that" but it's a toss-up to me.

===== page 16 =====

top of page:
sentence at top seems off. Perhaps: "SQL/MED (Management of External Data) is an extension in the SQL:2003 standard that defines how foreign-data wrappers (FDW) and datalink types allow SQL to be used to access data stored outside of the RDBMS."

And all works fine now. Great! The only missing
feature is the ability to make slaves-off-slave still
work when a slave gets promoted to standalone, but
unfortunately, it’s not here ??
