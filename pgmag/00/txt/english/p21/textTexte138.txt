Postgres 9.1 Beta1PostgreSQL beta versions are feature-frozen snapshots of the forthcoming 9.1 major release. They are not meant for production use. They are intended to preview and test upcoming features and to provide the possibility for early feedback. If you are a developer or a DBA, testing PostgreSQL betas is one of the best things you can do to help get the release out faster, with more features and less bugs.
