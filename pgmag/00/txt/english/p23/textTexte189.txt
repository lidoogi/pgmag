Get Ready for SQL/MED !SQL/MED (Management of External Data) is an extension to the SQL standard that defines foreign-data wrappers and datalink types to allow a DBMS to integrate date stored outside the database.The implementation of this specification has begun in PostgreSQL 8.4 and will be available in the forthcoming 9.1 version with the very first  foreign-data wrapper : file_fdw, which can be used to access data files in the server's filesystem.
