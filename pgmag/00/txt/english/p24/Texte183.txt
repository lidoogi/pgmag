Here are the basic steps to set up and use pgFouine:1. If you donâ€™t already have it, you will need to install php (via yum, manually, etc.):yum install php2. Get the latest version of pgFouine: wget http://.../pgfouine-1.2.tar.gztar -zxvf pgfouine-1.2.tar.gz3. In postgresql.conf, you will have to change the default log line prefix. For this example, the log destination is set to stderr rather than syslog : log_destination = 'stderr'logging_collector = truelog_line_prefix = '%t [%p]: [%l-1] 'log_min_duration_statement = 0Setting log_min_duration_statement to 0 will log all SQL statements. 4. Reload the postgres configuration:sudo -u postgres psqlselect pg_reload_conf();5. You might also force the pg log to roll over (this will allow you to generate a report off of a fresh log file): select pg_rotate_logfile();6. Now go do some things in your application (i.e. perform a sequence of activities that a user of your application might do), to capture some of the SQL statements that get run by the application. 7. To generate a report, run pgfouine.php on the command line, passing it the latest postgres log to use:./pgfouine.php -logtype stderr  \                -file postgresql.log \                 > report.htmlThe resulting report will look something like:
