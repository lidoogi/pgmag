repmgr 1.1.0 is out repmgr is a project developed by 2ndQuadrant to build large numbers of replicated PostgreSQL 9.0 standby servers.  By providing a system daemon outside of the database to help coordinate multi-node actions, repmgr makes putting many nodes into a cluster easier to setup and manage. repmgr currently targets UNIX-like systems, requiring access to the PGXS interface for compiling PostgreSQL related code and the rsync utility for efficient node synchronization.http://projects.2ndquadrant.com/repmgr
