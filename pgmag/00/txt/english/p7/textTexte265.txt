German doc translation project startedThe project to translate the PostgreSQL documentation into German has started. A small number of volunteers has gathered to work on tools for better maintenance and to make translations easier. For now,  what is not translated yet will be provided in English. The German translations will appear on the website little by little.http://doc.postgres.de
